# ByAllMeans

*Have you ever wanted to be a project manager?* <br>
*Have you ever dreamed about ruling a team of talented (and maybe not so talented) developers?* <br>
*Have you ever wondered what is it like to be responsible for other coders' lifes and carees?* <br>

If you answered yes, well, this game is just for you!

Here, you are the boss in your own firm. You can do whatever you want. You can hire a developer, fire them, promote your projects, 
and plenty of other things. But! You have one limit. It's money. You ought to be careful what you spend your money on. You can lose everything.
